SAMPLE PROGRAM

You can process the sample.x IDL file with rpcgen as: 

rpcgen sample.x

Stub files (C files), an XDRfile (C file), and sample.h header file will be generated automatically. Normally we should not edit those files. Depending on the operating system, you may need to play with the header file and Makefile. 

client.c and server.c are the programs that we develope (not automatically generated by rpcgen). They use the  stub functions, XDR functions,  and the header file. 

A Makefile is included to compile and generate the executable files: client and server. 

We just type: 
make 

Then, 

Run the server as 
./server


Run the client as: 
./client hostname value1 ... valueN

The client program will call two (remote) procedures: square and summation.  square()  will take the square of an integer argument. summation() function will sum all integers in the supplied array data. The results will be printed out. 

As hostname we can write the IP address of the server. 
For example: 
./client 139.179.AA.BB 10 20 30 40 50 

If client and server are on the same machine, then we use localhost as the server hostname as below: 

./client localhost 10 20 30 40 50
